# Bhai Saab - AI Assistant

## Overview

Hey there! Welcome to the Bhai Saab project — think of it as your chill, friendly AI buddy that’s here to help you get stuff done without the fuss. It’s inspired by Jarvis but with a laid-back vibe, just like me: a sorta clumsy dev figuring things out as we go. This project is all about building a conversational AI assistant that handles your calendar, tasks, emails, and more — while I document all the mess-ups and wins along the way.

## Features (What Bhai Saab Can Do)

### Core Stuff

-   **Conversational AI with Streaming Responses:** So it feels like you’re really chatting, not just waiting for long pauses.
-   **Google Calendar Access:** Check your schedule, upcoming events, and weekly plans.
-   **Google Tasks & Events:** Keep track of your to-dos without breaking a sweat.
-   **Email Notifications:** Bhai Saab will even shoot you emails when needed — no spam, promise.

### Stuff Coming Soon (Someday, Hopefully)

-   **Voice Agent:** Because typing is overrated, right?
-   **More Tools:** Notion note-taking, PDF chats to analyze documents, finance tracking, habit reminders — all on the wishlist.
-   **And More:** If you think of neat features, shout out!

## Tech Stack (What’s Under the Hood)

-   **Next.js + React:** For the snappy, responsive UI you deserve.
-   **Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui:** Making sure Bhai Saab looks clean and works everywhere.
-   **Langchain v1:** The brains behind the whole AI conversation magic.
-   **Supabase:** Storing your chats, preferences, and keeping things secure.
-   **Google APIs + Email Services:** So Bhai Saab can peek at your calendar and ping your inbox.
-   **Deployment:** Hosted on Vercel because who wants servers to manage?

## Why This Project?

-   To build something real and useful, even if I screw up along the way.
-   To keep all my progress out in the open — transparency ftw.
-   To invite you in: ideas, PRs, feedback — all welcome with open arms.
-   To blog about every step because nothing feels better than sharing the journey of figuring stuff out.

## What’s Next?

Starting simple: Project setup and getting Bhai Saab to chat with you (yes, no fancy streaming just yet). Then we’ll add tools and APIs one by one. I’ll keep you posted here, and if you want to say which feature should go live next — hit me up!
